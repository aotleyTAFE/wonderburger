# conflict
## my own repo
To resolve conflict in my repo, the team members and I discussed where to place the new ingredient, relative to other ingredients. I then added the new ingredient in that spot as a new line and then merged.
## with my branch in someone else's repo
To resolve the conflict with my branch in another repo, the owner and team members and I discussed where to place the new ingredient. We agreed upon a position for it and then the owner added it to that position as a new line and merged.
